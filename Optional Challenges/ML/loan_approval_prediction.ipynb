    "In the bustling city of Financia, the Central Lending Institution (CLI) is the largest provider of loans to individuals and businesses. With a mission to support economic growth and financial stability, CLI processes thousands of loan applications every month. However, the traditional manual review process is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to delays and inconsistencies in loan approvals.\n",
    "To address these challenges, CLI has decided to leverage the power of machine learning to streamline their loan approval process. They have compiled a comprehensive dataset containing historical loan application records, including various factors such as credit scores, income levels, employment status, loan terms(measured in years), loan amounts, asset values, and the final loan status (approved or denied).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of loan approval based on the provided features. By doing so, you will help CLI make faster, more accurate, and fairer lending decisions, ultimately contributing to the financial well-being of the community.\n",

    "It is recommended that you follow the typical machine learning workflow: \n",
    "1. Data Collection: Gather the data you need for your model. (Already done for you)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis. (Already done for you)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data and its patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model Selection: Choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model Training: Train the model using the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using a validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Model Optimization: Optimize the model's parameters to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Model Testing: Test the final model on a separate test dataset.\n",
